# UK COVID-19 Data Visualisation
## Description

**Work in Progress**

This tool is designed to visualise the data that is available using the Covid-19 API provided by the United Kingdoms government.

The red and blue parts indicate the national lockdowns and vaccine rollout respectively. 
This highligting can be turned on and off using the checkboxes.

I am not currently sure how I am gonna present the data.

Below is an example of the dash dashboard that I am currently working on.
